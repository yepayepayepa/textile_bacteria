Telar's code became self-aware and tried to escape. I built a containment unit. "Textile Bacteria" is the result.

The piece is based on the 1970's work of the British mathematician John Conway's "Conway's Game of Life" cellular automaton. To avoid bacteria from dying when one of the threads ends up entirely on top of the other the algorithm adds one pseudorandom artificial cross in the weaving feeding the creatures keeping at the same time the weave consistent.

- Left-click to feed dead bacteria.
- Use the arrow keys to flip between the face and the back of the fabric.
- Press 'SPACE' on your keyboard to pause/play. 
- Press 'ENTER' on your keyboard to rewind. 
- Press 'F' on your keyboard to toggle between full-screen and regular view. 
- Press 'S' on your keyboard to save it as a 36 megapixels print.
